1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I would like to make my changes available to others.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I wouldn't to make changes public until I was ready.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks make a copy of a github repository to your own github repository. A clone pulls a copy of repository on github into your local repository. A branch is a commit that has been made outside of the master branch.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This would make it possible for me to see the differences between my local changes and the most recent github repository before pushing additional changes to GitHub.
