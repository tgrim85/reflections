1. What happens when you initialize a repository? What do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized it has no commits yet.  Something must be committed before git can track changes.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area provides a place where files can be added prior to being committed. The working directory is the directory I am currently working in on my hard drive and the repository stores what I commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can make sure that I use the staging area and get diff to ensure that changes I am getting ready to commit are in logical pieces.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would allow me to explore new ideas or features without messing with a working version of my program.
