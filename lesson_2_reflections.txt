1. What happens when you initialize a repository? What do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized it has no commits yet.  Something must be committed before git can track changes.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area provides a place where files can be added prior to being committed. The working directory is the directory I am currently working in on my hard drive and the repository stores what I commit.
